## Notes

I want to build an app that helps people find available parking spaces near their location. I want the app to let people know whether the spaces near them are private or public. I think the User Interface would be a map similar to the way the Maps app looks, except that as the user moves in real life, their icon in the app will also move and green spots would appear in areas where there is available public parking, and read spots where there is private/paid parking. A cool feature to implement using AI would be letting users have an idea using predictions of how likely they are to find parking in a given area at a given time, even if they are not in that area just yet.


Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
